# gardenjs.org

[Garden.js](https://github.com/rabbitdevelopment/garden) is a lightweight and superfast component library explorer for UI development, testing and documentation.

## Website & documentation

This is the [Garden.js website](https://garden.rabbitdevelopment.com/) with the documentation and this is a [Garden.js demo](https://gardendemo.rabbitdevelopment.com/) from this website.

You can use this repository as a code demo of Garden. We use Svelte here which then works in a similar way for other supported Frameworks like Vue and React.

Happy Gardening :)

## Todos

- [Bug] In dark mode, the header image browser bar is in "light mode" when you switch pages and then return to the homepage.
