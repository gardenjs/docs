[Garden](https://github.com/rabbitdevelopment/garden) is a lightweight and superfast component library explorer for UI development, testing and documentation.

This repository contains the [website](https://garden.rabbitdevelopment.com/) with the documentation and this is a [Garden demo](https://gardendemo.rabbitdevelopment.com/) from this website. You can use this repository as a code demo of Garden. We use Svelte here which then works the same way for other supported frameworks like Vue and React (Garden can also be easily extended for other JS frameworks).

Happy Gardening :)
