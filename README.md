# Garden's landing page

The Storybook alternative [Garden](https://github.com/rabbitdevelopment/garden) is a lightweight and superfast component library explorer for UI development, testing and documentation. Garden's landing page can be found [here](https://garden.rabbitdevelopment.com/) and the actual Garden demo is [here](https://gardendemo.rabbitdevelopment.com/).

 Use this repository as a code demo for implementing Garden in a project, rendering components to the Garden app in the browser, and defining stories. We use Svelte here, which then works in a similar way for Vue and React.

Happy Gardening :)

## Todos

- [Bug] In dark mode, the header image browser bar is in "light mode" when you switch pages and then return to the home page.
