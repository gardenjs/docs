# Garden website

[Garden](https://github.com/rabbitdevelopment/garden) is a lightweight and superfast component library explorer for UI development, testing and documentation.

This is the [Garden website](https://garden.rabbitdevelopment.com/) with the documentation and this is the website as a [Garden demo](https://gardendemo.rabbitdevelopment.com/).

You can view this repository as a code demo of Garden. We use Svelte here which then works in a similar way for other supported Frameworks like Vue and React.

Happy Gardening :)

## Todos

- [Bug] In dark mode, the header image browser bar is in "light mode" when you switch pages and then return to the homepage.
