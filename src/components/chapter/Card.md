# Cards with h3 title and paragraph

## Options

All options can be combined with each other:

1. The cards can be issued with different background colors (white, yellow & turquoise).
2. The cards can be displayed at an angle - ascending or descending. If presented at an angle, the card goes beyond its content area. The content area is represented by the dashed line.

## Note

In this example, a decorator is used to create a dashed frame around the card. In addition, the upward distance is created so that cards do not run out of the visible area when displayed at an angle.
