# Chapter

The chapter combines several components

- “Chapter intro” (h1 or h2 heading optionally with a teaser text).
- “Cards” (optionally with a rotation on the left or right and background colors white, turquoise or yellow).
- Layout component "Grid", which displays the content boxes either in two or three columns.
