# Navbar with Logo and header navigation

The navbar disappears when scrolling on the homepage, while it is fixed at the top on the subpages and documentation pages.

Test darkmode/lightmode behavior via the mode icon inside the component.

In the documentation, the burger icon to open the sidenav is shown on smaller displays.
