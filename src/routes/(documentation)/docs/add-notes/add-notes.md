# Add notes

Text can be added to each component as short notes/comments or formatted texts, e.g. for detailed documentation. Code blocks with text highlighting are also possible. This text is then displayed in the panel below the component in the “Notes” tab.

You can either write plain text or markdown directly into *foo.das.js*, or you can specify a path to a markdown file.

```js
export default {
  name: 'Foo',
  file: './Foo.svelte',
  description: "./foo.md",
}
```
