# Introduction

Garden is an alternative to Storybook as component library explorer for UI development, testing and documentation. Garden is significantly faster than comparable tools - regardless of the project size. Svelte, Vue and React are currently supported, but other frameworks should also be easily connectable to Garden.

But not only Garden works faster, but also working with Garden: Both outputting components in Garden and defining stories with Garden is very easy, fast and clear.

The barrier to entry is very low: Garden focuses on the essential requirements of development without sacrificing essential functions.

## Features

Garden is a slim alternative to the top dog, but it already has a nice features.

* The output of components in Garden is defined in extra files, as well as stories or infotexts/docus. Thus the components remain completely pure.
* Stories can be defined to each component/layout and accessed directly.
* Page tree with all components/layouts. Additional page trees can also be included, e.g. to separate components and layouts.
* Keyword search in the page tree.
* Show the size of the stage as pixels.
* Change the size of the stages through an icon navi.
* Show the components/layouts with your different themes.
* Open the components/layouts in an empty new browser tab.
* Dark mode and light mode.
* Option to add info text to each component/layout, e.g. for documentation or as additional information. As markdown in the component.das.js file or as a separate markdown file including text highlighting.
* Panel with navigation that displays ...
  * the info text including text highlighting.
  * the story navigation to switch between the created stories.
  * the component/layout code for a quick insight.
* Many other settings can already be made via a configuration file, as well as your own settings.
* Screenshot tests are currently available for testing.

We cover many of the features here in the documentation, but be sure to check out the demo as well.

## What's next?

The whole thing runs stably and extremely fast, is suitable for projects of all sizes and will be maintained in its current form. We have also already created a list of additional tasks and features for upcoming versions. Whether we add that and even roll it out to more frameworks like Solid also has to do with how Garden is received by you guys out there and whether we'll get support if necessary.

We look forward to your ideas, advice and support.
