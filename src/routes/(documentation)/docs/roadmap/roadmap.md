# Roadmap

Gardenjs will continue to be maintained and further functions will be integrated. We have also compiled a list of other great features. These are aimed at the different areas of development, testing, user experience and customization.
We want to make development with Gardenjs easier and also expand the range of Gardenjs functions. We also want to integrate testing tools and further optimize the UX of Gardenjs. We are also considering making the appearance of Gardenjs even more customizable. Stay tuned.

## Would you like to get involved?

Please contact us if you would like to help with the development. A donation model is also planned if Gardenjs is well received.
