# Introduction

## What is Gardenjs?

Gardenjs is a component library explorer for UI development, testing and documentation. Gardenjs is significantly faster than comparable tools such as Storybook - regardless of the project size.

But not only Gardenjs is extremely fast, but also working with Gardenjs: both the output of components in Gardenjs and the definition of stories with Gardenjs is very simple, fast and clear. For a clean project, the definition of stories and documentation are created separately from the components themselves.

The barrier to entry is very low: Gardenjs concentrates on the essential requirements of development without sacrificing essential functions.

Even though Gardenjs is a lean, fast alternative, it is not lacking in useful features such as <a href="/docs/get-started/hooks">hooks</a> and <a href="/docs/get-started/decorators">decorators</a>. More features are on the <a href="/docs/roadmap">roadmap</a>.

## Which frameworks and template languages are supported?

Gardenjs currently supports Svelte, Vue and React through renderer plugins and HTML Snippets - multi-framework projects are possible. To ensure that other frameworks and template languages also work, corresponding plugins must be created. More information on this can be found <a href="/docs/renderer/">here</a>.

## Demo

Gardenjs is a slim alternative to the top dog, but it has some nice features. Take a look at the <a href="https://demo.gardenjs.org/" target="_blank">demo</a>.

## What's next?

Gardenjs runs stable and is extremely fast, is suitable for projects of all sizes and is maintained in its current form. We have also already created a long list of additional tasks and features for upcoming versions. Whether we add all of them and create corresponding renderer plugins for other frameworks and template languages also has to do with how Gardenjs is received by you out there and whether we will get support if necessary.

We look forward to your ideas, advice and support.
