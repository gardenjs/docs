We initially used Gardenjs for our own projects, but since it does some things better than alternative tools, we have now released it. As enthusiastic users of open source software, this gives us the opportunity to give something back.</p>'

      content: '<p>The question is provocative and of course each tool has its own advantages and disadvantages. Certainly, the top dog also covers many features that are not or not yet integrated in Gardenjs. But Gardenjs is definitely much faster and leaner. In our opinion, "stories" can be created more efficiently with Gardenjs, the handling is smoother and the option to work with decorators is more flexible. In addition, Gardenjs is multiframework-compatible, unlike Strorybook. And of course Gardenjs looks much better ;) Much is a matter of taste, form your own opinion - we look forward to your feedback.</p>'

Whether and how actively we will work through the <a href="${base}/docs/roadmap">roadmap</a> depends on our own needs for Gardenjs and to a large extent on how well Gardenjs is accepted and how much support we receive.</p>`
