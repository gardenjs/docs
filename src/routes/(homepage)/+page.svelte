  <Subchapter
    title="In Gardenjs, your components grow at the speed of light"
    paragraph="Gardenjs is a Svelte app and thus benefits from its super speed. Gardenjs starts almost instantly within 2s. In action, code changes in Gardenjs are reflected by the Vite build tool at the speed of light — significantly faster than Storybook or comparable tools." />
  <Subchapter
    title="Use Gardenjs with your favorite JS framework"
    paragraph="Use Gardenjs out of the box with Svelte, Vue and React. If you want to use a previously unsupported framework, you can write a plugin with little effort, so that your components are rendered in Gardenjs as well. Or support us to integrate more frameworks." />

  <Subchapter
    title="Use Gardenjs in multiframework projects"
    paragraph="You can use Gardenjs out of the box even in a multiframework project - Storybook and others can't do that." />

  <ChapterIntro
    superscript="Our story"
    title="Why another tool like Storybook?" />
  <Subchapter
    title="A brief insight into the development of Gardenjs"
    paragraph="Storybook is the top dog and a very powerful, great tool. So why Garden? Gardenjs was initially developt as a practice project to better understand the then-new framework Svelte. Right off the bat, Gardenjs was significantly faster than Storybook and all its alternatives. From then on, we used Gardenjs for all our projects. So Gardenjs was constantly maintained and extended with more features. Gardenjs now has all the essential functions needed to create, test and document UI components and is also comparatively easy to maintain and further develop. Gardenjs also does some things better than the alternatives. So we're late to the party but it would be a shame not to make Gardenjs available to everyone." />
  <Subchapter
    title="Contributions and donations are welcome"
    paragraph="Gardenjs is actively maintained. We will integrate some useful features in the future and are open for further requests. We are happy about your support. Please report bugs on Github." />
  <Subchapter
    title="Sponsors"
    paragraph="Become a sponsor to give us more scope for further development. We are grateful for this and will publish your logo and website URL in our README on Github and here on the Gardenjs website/documentation." />
